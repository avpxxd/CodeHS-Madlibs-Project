This Project Was Made For A CodeHS Assignment.
It Is Literally Just A Mad Libs Game With 4 Unique Prompts.
A Prompt Gets Chosen At Random, And You Fill In The Blanks From There.
There Is No Sorts Of Filters To Ensure What Was Entered Is In Fact A Noun / Number / Adjective, Etc. (May Implement Later) 
Press Zero To Cancel Is Buggy. At The Moment It Just Crashes The Program (To Be Fair, It DOES Cancel.) (May Fix Later)
